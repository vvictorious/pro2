The idea behind this project is to make a body-journal app.  My vision is to create an app wthat uses authentication to make a tailored journal for each user.  Once logged in the user can navigate to their Journal.  In the journal the user will be able to inpout their daily fitness routine, weight, and a picture.  This information should log to the database so that the user can refer to what they had written in the past and see their progress.  Thus far, I have Authentication.  Also, I have the first part of the journal complete.  The user can put something they did fitness related into the input field, and what they wrote gets appended to the screen.  I still have a lot of things to do before this project is complete.  Currently, I am working on putting the users journal data to a different route where it can be updated, or deleted if desired.  Furthermore, I still need to insert a photo API, and better the authentication.  
Thus far I have learned a lot in doing this project.  I got more experience using Node, MongoDB, Heroku, Routes, Github, EJS, Models, Schemas, Middleware, and AJAX.  All of these technologies were pretty new to me, and I struggled to make it as far as I have so far.  However, as I made progress in the app I have gotten better at finding answers to the problems that I stumble upon.  That may be the most important skill that I have gained from this project.
